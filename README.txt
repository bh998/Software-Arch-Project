**Note**
In order to use the mysql database with other servers, you must install the package php-mysql for linux in order to use the mysql commands in php.

Server setup was a LAMP server:
Linux
Apache
MySql
Php

In the test folder there is a database_setup.php script that is used to setup the database with the correct tables and a default user.

Use "mysql -u user -p" then hit enter to enter password to access mysql cli.
